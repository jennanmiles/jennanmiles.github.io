# Homework 1

## Overview
Welcome to my portfolio. I created a one-page layout for ease of use and updated the design styles to be modern and simple. I added a section about skillset in order to visually convey my competencies. My linkedin, email, and resume are available via the icons, and my form will soon submit messages to my inbox.
